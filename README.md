# New Family Historian Stylesheet

When you publish a website from [Family Historian](https://www.family-historian.co.uk/), the pages have some visual and layout problems in modern browsers, especially on mobile devices.

This project provides an alternative stylesheet to resolve some of these issues and provide a more modern look.

To use, simply download [fhstyle.css](https://github.com/kimmknight/newfhstyle/raw/main/fhstyle.css) below and add it to your published site (replacing the existing **fhstyle.css**).

This is a work in progress and has not been widely tested.
