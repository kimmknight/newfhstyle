# About

When you publish a website from Family Historian, the pages some visual and layout problems in modern browsers, especially on mobile devices.

This project provides an alternative stylesheet to resolve some of these issues and provide a more modern look.

To use, simply download **fhstyle.css** below and add it to your published site (replacing the existing **fhstyle.css**).

This is a work in progress and has not been widely tested.
